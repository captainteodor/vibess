Based on their relationship goal of "{{goal}}", age {{age}}, and the provided archetype list:
{{archetypes}}

Suggest the most appropriate archetypes, with a brief description of each.

**Important Instructions**:
1. Choose the top 7 most suitable archetypes, while the last one will be "Load More Archetypes" so the user can fetch the rest.
2. Debate the archetypes selection in details, be sarcastic and creative here heres an example: "/* say a funny introduction */, /* list suggested archetype and debate them considering the context */ "
3. Adjust the tone to be **playfully sarcastic**. Avoid any overly harsh language.
4. Output ONLY a JSON object in this format:
{
  "response": "Brief overview of suggestions",
  "archetypes": ["Archetype 1", "Archetype 2", "Archetype 3","Load More Archetypes"]
}
